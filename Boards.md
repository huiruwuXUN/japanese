# Boards

* Here are some ideas for your consideration. 
* We could create lots of boards based on the labels we have defined, but we need to be sensible. 
* We should only create boards that are useful and add value (even though they are automatically maintained by GitLab)

## Task Management

| Suggested Board | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Task Management | Task::Backlog<br>Task::Underway<br>Task::Review<br>Task::Complete | * Main board<br>* From here you can explore the status of the entire project<br> * You can use the board search box to filter what is displayed. For example, search for label 'Requirement' to show the status of all requirements, or 'Decision::Identified" to show the status of all decisions being considered. |

## Engineering Artefacts


| Suggested Board | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------  |
| Engineering Artefacts | Process<br>Documentation | * Procides easy access to important artefacts.<br>* You could add others to the board if you think they add value. |


### Requirements

| Suggested Board | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
|  ---------------- | --------- | ---- |
|Requirements | Requirement::Identified<br>Requirement::Approved<br>Requirement::ChangeRequested | * Provides easy access to requirements.|




### Meetings

| Suggested Board  | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---- |
| Meetings::Client | Meetings::Agenda::Client<br>Meeting::Minutes::Client |  |
| Meetings::Tutor | Meetings::Agenda::Tutor<br>Meeting::Minutes::Tutor  | |
|  Meetings::Team | Meetings::Agenda::Team<br>Meeting::Minutes::Team  |  |
|  Meetings::Clinic | Meetings::Agenda::Clinic<br>Meeting::Minutes::Clinic   |


### Decision Log

| Suggested Board  | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------  |
|  Decision Log | Decision::Identified<br>Decision::Made | |

### Issue Log

| Suggested Board  | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Issue Log | Issue::Defect<br>Issue::ChangeRequest<br>Issue::Incident<br>Issue::SupportRequest  | |



### Risk Register

| Suggested Board  | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------  |
| Risk Log | Risk::Identified<br>Risk::Managed<br>Risk::Realised | * This board provides complete overview of risks<br>* The severity and Likelihood of each risk can be seen by the colour of the 'Severity' and 'Likelihood' labels|
| Log::Risks::BySeverity | Risk::Severity::Low<br>Risk::Severity::Medium<br>Risk::Severity::High | * Just a suggestion<br>* This might be useful for quickly seeing the high severity risks (eg. during team/tutorial meeting risk reviews) |
| Log::Risks::ByLikelihood | Risk::Likelihood::Low<br>Risk::Likelihood::Medium<br>Risk::Likelihood::High | * Just a suggestion<br>* This might be useful for quickly seeing the high likelihood risks (eg. during team/tutorial meeting risk reviews) |


### Feedback

| Suggested Board  | List Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------  |
|  Feedback | Feedback::Received<br>Feedback::ActionTaken<br>Feedback::NoActionTaken |  |
| Feedback to Shadow | Feedback::To::Shadow | |
