# Labels

* Here are some suggestions for your consideration. 
* You will probably experiment with labels and board design during the project



## Task Allocation and Tracking

* Your main focus should be on ensuring that all work is represented and tracked in GitLab
* Everything that requires work should be identified as an issue in GitLab. 
* These issues should be labeled as Engineering artefacts, meetings, decisions, risks etc. as detailed below
* In order to track the status of work, issues should also be labeled using one of the 'Task' labels described below. For example, a decision will be an issue with a 'Decision' label and a 'Task' label such as 'Task::Underway'. Later this label will be changed to 'Task:Review' and then 'Task::Complete'


| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Task::Backlog<br>Task::Underway<br>Task::Review<br>Task::Complete | * As time goes on, you may need to additional labels |



## Engineering Artefacts

Everything you do should be added to GitLab as an issue. This will allow you to allocate and track the work required to complete the artefact.

### Basic artefects/activities

* You may like to create some labels to allocate and keep track of work related to basic engineering artefacts and activities. 
* Any work associated with these artfects can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.


| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
|  ---------------- | --------- |
|Process<br>Research<br>Learning<br>Administration<br>Notes<br>Requirement<br>Architecture<br>Design<br>Code<br>Deployment<br>Documentation<br>Test | * Here are some ideas<br>* You will probably add more as the project proceeds<br>* These labels can be used to create boards that show the status of your your requirements, documentation, tests etc.<br>* These basic artefacts and activities don't require any other specific detailed labels like meetings, decisions etc., described below. However, such detailed labels can be added if required.|

### Requirements

| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
|Requirement::Identified<br>Requirement::Approved<br>Requirement::ChangeRequested| * Requirements are identified, then later approved by stakeholders. After approval they may be subject to change.<br>* The work required to identify and manage requirements can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.|



### Meetings

| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Meeting::Agenda::Client<br>Meeting::Agenda::Clinic<br>Meeting::Agenda::Team<br>Meeting::Agenda::Tutorial    |  |
| Meeting::Minutes::Client<br> Meeting::Minutes::Clinic<br> Meeting::Minutes::Team<br> Meeting::Minutes::Tutorial  | Make meeting agenda and minutes labels the same colour. Try to have a specific colour for each logical grouping of labels - meetings, decisions, risks, tasks etc.) |

* Like other artefacts, the work required to create meeting agenda and minutes can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.


### Decisions


| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Decision::Identified<br>Decision::Made | * The work required to make decisions can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.<br>* You might add labels to capture impact etc. |


### Risks

| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Risk::Identified<br>Risk::Managed<br>Risk::Realised | * The work required to identify and manage risks can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.<br>* Risks are closed by using GitLab's close issue function |
Risk::Treatment::Accept<br>Risk::Treatment::Mitigate<br>Risk::Treatment::Transfer| As per [TL Note on Risk Management](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Risk%20Management.pdf)|
| Risk::Severity::Low<br>Risk::Severity::Medium<br>Risk::Severity::High | * You may like to use a different set of severity levels<br>* Use label colour (eg. green, yellow, red) to indicated severity | | Risk::Likelihood::Low<br>Risk::Likelihood::Medium<br>Risk::Likelihood::High | * You may like to use a different set of likelihood levels<br>* Use label colour (eg. green, yellow, red) to indicated likelihood |


### Feedback

* The main thing here is to track your treatment of external feedback. You need to keep a record of all feedback and what you did about it.

| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
|  Feedback::From::Client<br> Feedback::From::Clinic<br> Feedback::From::Self<br> Feedback::From::Shadow<br> Feedback::From::Tutor | * These labels are related to parent category of 'Feedback'<br>* They indicate who provided the feedback<br>* The work required to create, review and act on feedback can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.  |
Reflection::Provided<br>Reflection::Action<br>Reflection::NonAction<br>Requirement::Fulfill | Feedback::Received<br>Feedback::ActionTaken<br>Feedback::NoActionTaken | * These labels indicate how you have dealt with the feedback<br>* I don't see why you need 'Fullfil'. At the end of the process you just need to indicate if action was taken or not taken (along with your rational)|


### Issues

| Suggested Labels | Rational/Notes  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Issue::Defect<br>Issue::ChangeRequest<br>Issue::Incident<br>Issue::SupportRequest | * Issues could be categorised to provide better visibility of project status<br>* Here are some suggested categories (labels)<br> * The work required to create, review and act on issues can be allocated and tracked using the 'Task' labels described above.  |
