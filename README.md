#### details image preprocessing: 

Image preprocessing is crucial for the Pair Creation stage, as it enhances the quality of images through contrast enhancement and sharpening, making important features more prominent. This aids in accurate recognition and learning of information within the images by the model. Additionally, image normalization ensures that the pixel values across all images are within the same range, promoting data consistency and stabilizing model training. The denoising and background removal in preprocessing reduce interference in the images, enabling the model to focus more on the primary content of the images, thereby generating clearer and cleaner image pairs during the Pair Creation stage. This not only improves computational efficiency and accelerates the generation of positive and negative image pairs, but also allows for visual inspection to verify the effects of preprocessing, ensuring that high-quality and consistent image data is provided for model training.

#### Branch out (OCR method):
Our current approach is outlined in the project milestones. After initial image preprocessing, we employ the OCR method provided by Manga_OCR to recognize each character. Following this, we evaluate the accuracy using our API and identify various constraints. Currently our program have the ability to recognize and classify single character. Our future steps involve the implementation of a completed system with capability on all common-appear character and classify leaflets based on characters set.

#### Branch out (image encoding):
Based on the recommendation of Dr. Mohammed, we sought to enhance the original set of images through various techniques, such as increasing contrast and binarization. The objective was to investigate the potential benefits of these enhancements on the embeddings produced by the CLIP model. By examining the cosine similarity between embeddings, we aimed to determine the most effective enhancement method.
